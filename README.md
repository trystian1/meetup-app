# meetup-app

This is the meetup app I created for the udacity senior front-end developer course.
It is created with React and Redux and with an ES6 syntax.
Build tools I used are gulp and webpack. I run webpack to build the ES6 syntax to 'normal' javascript.

# install

- Clone the repository
- Go to the folder
- Run npm install
- Run webpack-dev-server
- Go to localhost
